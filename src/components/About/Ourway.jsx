          <span>
            In 2004, fellow MIT graduate students Brian Halligan and Dharmesh
            Shah noticed a major shift in the way people shop and purchase
            products. Buyers didnâ€™t want to be interrupted by ads, they wanted
            helpful information. In 2006, they founded HubSpot to help companies
            use that shift to grow better with inbound marketing. Along the way,
            HubSpot expanded beyond marketing into a crafted, not cobbled suite
            of products that create the frictionless customer experience that
            buyers expect today. Expertly led by CEO Yamini Rangan, HubSpot uses
            its customer platform built on an AI-powered Smart CRM to help
            millions of scaling organizations grow better.
